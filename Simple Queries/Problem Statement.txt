Given an array A consisting of N positive integers, and Q queries on it. The queries can be of five types:

1 l r - let S - sorted set of elements with indices between l and r. You need to find:


2 x y - assign the value y to element at position x.
3 x - delete element at position x from array.
4 z y - insert y after element at position z. If z equal 0 then y should insert before the first element.
5 l r - count the number of distinct numbers in array between indices l and r.
All the indices in the queries are 1-based.

Array always contains at least one element.

Input
The first line of input contains two integers N and Q denoting the number of elements in A, and the number of queries to be executed. The second line of input contains N integers denoting the array A. Each of the next Q lines contains one query.

Output
For each query of type 1 or type 5, output the answer to the query in a single line.

Constraints
1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 105
1 ≤ Ai, y ≤ 109 + 6
1 ≤ x ≤ |A|
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ |A|
0 ≤ z ≤ |A|
